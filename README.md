## About

IdentiFont saves web designers, UI/UX engineers, and typeface enthusiasts from the odious task of having to dig through the source code of a web page to find a burried font-family. 

Simply hover over the text you are interested in, and IdentiFont will respond with a popup including the names of the fonts used.
